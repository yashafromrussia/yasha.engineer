Hi internet! I'm Yasha, a software engineer. I was born in Khabarovsk, Russia. Moved to Toronto, Canada when I was 13. And I'm currently living in Sydney, Australia ü¶ò. I'm currently working at [Bonsai](https://getbonsai.com). I'm passionate about building software that helps other developers, learning new things, and sharing my knowledge with others.

Some of my favourite tools are:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
- [Litmus](https://litmuschaos.io/)
- [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)

That's all for now. I'll be posting more soon.

Cheers! üçª
